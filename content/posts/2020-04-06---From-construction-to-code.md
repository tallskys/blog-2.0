I feel like my path to becoming a developer has been an odd, but not completely unique tale. The cliffnotes of my pre-construction life is this - I went to Indiana University for a creative writing degree, during my sophomore year I had a severe depressive episode due to my bipolar disorder which was undiagnosed at that time and couldn't get out of bed for days, after fighting this for multiple semesters I eventually failed out. I hopped from shitty retail job to shitty kitchen job for years, alternating apartment-hopping and living out of my truck. Until I eventually got drunk one night at the bar I worked next door to and met an amicable and overly-kind electrician who offered me a job where he worked. I showed up, they needed warm bodies, it was a match made in heaven.

From there I had purpose. Construction gave me structure for the first time in years, I had to be on the job at 7am sharp every day. I also found out quickly I needed a full nights sleep before, even if some electricians came over in a hungover haze every day, I personally wasn't fond of messing with live electricity when my brain wasn't fully functioning. So I started to go to sleep earlier to combat that. My bad habits started to naturally slough off once I had a job that didn't require insane hell-hours like working until 1am and coming back at 6am to open.

But construction was just a waypoint for me, a marker on a longer road, I knew I didn't want to spend the rest of my days working hard long hours until my body broke down. For all the good construction did me, it was still rough going. For two years I made $13/hr for a job that required intense physical output. At this point I lived in a house with a friend, but on that salary I was barely paycheck to paycheck. I alternated late-fees on which bills I wouldn't be able to pay on time that month.

So I started to do research into what high-paying jobs I could get without a college degree. I know that's almost crass in it's directness, but going back and finishing college didn't just seem like a chore, it seemed a monolithic impossiblity to me. My brain couldn't comprehend it. It was either crab-fishing or coding for me. Crabs creep me out.

So I started studying code day and night - running through code tutorials during the long truck rides to job-sites, on lunch breaks I'd sit alone in the corner reading Kyle Simpson's books, and every night I'd get home and do the same, even when I was so tired I could barely stand. I devoured everything I could. Every variable and arrow function and component was another rung on a ladder I would use to climb my way out of mediocrity.

I eventually shot out probably hundreds of applications, many of which I was wildly unqualified for, and got a few call backs. One company said my coding skills weren't quite up to snuff (they weren't wrong) but I was good enough to bring on in a QA capacity since I clearly understood enough to test things. I was in. I got the call about getting the job while getting beers with my brother, beers I had to ask him to cover since I was so broke, and I still remember the wave of relief that flooded through me. Like a lifeline had picked me up from the middle of an inferno. I cried tears of joy in a sports-bar parking lot, but who hasn't done that?

Learning to code has given me a lot. My pay more than tripled, I now never have to worry about being late on bills, I feel intelectually and creatively challenged by my job, I've made some of the best friends I've ever had, and it's a job that gives me the freedom to pursue creative things that I want to, like music and writing.

I also learned a lot about myself in the process. I learned that I'm the type of person who sometimes needs their feet set to the fire before they start to do anything. I learned that I'm good at a skill I previously never even considered to be in my realm of possibility. Mainly I learned that I could not have made these life-altering changes without benevolent strangers giving me a chance, that's a kindness I hope to pay forward throughout my life.
