So I'm going to start writing a gratefulness list on here every now and again. This probably seems like something that should go in a personal journal, but I wanted to give anyone who reads this a look into who I am, so here we are. Not to mention, there's already a veritable ocean full of negative bullshit online, so here's some positive bullshit instead.

My Friends - I know, it's the most cliche thing I could put here, but it also deserves to be at the top. I have, like most adults, had a rotating cast of friends over the last couple of decades. Still, I feel particularly lucky that I haven't lost too many contacts over the years, and some of my closest friends I've known for most of my life at this point. They're loving, supportive, open, and incredible people every single one. I cannot believe how lucky I am to call them friends.
Music - Thanks to Spotify's end of the year recaps, I was reminded just how huge music is for me in my day to day. I listened to over 550 hours of music this last year, and I honestly expected the number to be higher. Though, Spotify, we need to have a talk about your genres, "Swedish Americana" is not a thing that exists in this world.
Therapists - Specifically mine, because she is dope. But honestly, I'm just grateful for therapists and therapy in general. I wish everyone in the first world would go to therapists, I honestly don't think there's a person who would not benefit from going. Even if you don't believe you have any issues or problems, I will bet just talking to someone will make you realize otherwise, it will help. It's kind of like this blog for me, but someone is actually paying attention.
Pets - Again, specifically, my perfect dog Tyson. He is an anxious and nervy ball of fur that makes the most bizarre noises and emits the foulest smells, and I adore him. Having someone at home who is just generally jazzed that you exist is the best feeling, and really saves a lot of shitty days. Animals are the best, and we don't deserve them.
Tatoos - I have a few of them, and I'm planning on getting many more. As a person who has struggled with self-esteem and not being content with my outward appearance, I love tattoos and how they allow us to reclaim our bodies. Maybe I'm not happy with my body, but I picked out this artwork, picked out an artist, and made something unique and beautiful using my self. It's my absolute favorite form of self-love.
