It's strange the way seaweed wraps around dead bodies. I mean I'm sure it does the same to live bodies, but we never sit still long enough for it to wrap around us ten times over. Then to see it move with the water, it becomes a living dress, a thing with far more life than what it's clinging to.

> Today I'm pulling a young woman out of the river and I first see her hand through the murky river water, a pale branch reaching upwards. She went in this morning, I know because my sensors were tripped while I was making my coffee. A few hours is apparently enough time for a body to get completely engulfed by seaweed because she has less of a dress now and more of a thick winter parka. I spend about fifteen minutes cutting through the thick ropy strands focusing intensely on my task. I do not like being underwater, I hate it actually. Only being able to see a few feet in front of your face means you're always guessing what's coming up, the anxiety like a live-wire in your throat. But being a Body Diver is one of the last few honest ways of working, and the money is decent, so I focus on that and keep cutting.

She's eventually let loose and when I see her fully I realize just how much she looks like my sister. The last time I saw my sister was years ago, a day before the bombs fell. I remember laughing on her porch with beers in hand, the sunset was pink and orange and the world looked like a painting. It's like the world wanted to give me one last taste of beauty before it burned everything down. My sister didn't die in the bombings, but her bleeding heart meant she could not stand living in such a cold and dead world, so she was one of the first wave of bridge jumpers. It became an epidemic - like viral depression - we never took into account with bomb survival the intense and overbearing guilt that comes when you do survive.

This girl's face is like an inverse of my sister's that day on the porch, a bloated emotionless version. Or maybe she doesn't actually look like my sister at all, maybe she's just a dead woman and I'm lonely and crazy. I hook my arms under hers and start the slow swim back to shore. 

I pull her out of the water and delicately lay her down on her back. The air a balm against my skin as I take my diving gear off, being in that always makes me feel like I'm being slowly suffocated. It'll probably take me a full day to get the body to an outpost for pay, and I decide I'll wait until tomorrow morning. 

I sit down next to the body and look at her again. No, she does look like my sister. I can almost imagine being back on the porch with the sunset and the beers. Only this time the sky isn't pink and orange, and this time there isn't laughter, there's barely any sound at all.
