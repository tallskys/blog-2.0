I'm on a mission to learn or re-learn as much as possible in the fields of my choice, coding and music. I learn the best by absorbing info, building things using that, and then writing those things down, so that's what I'm going to do here. These aren't tutorials, though hopefully some may be helpful to more people than just myself.
